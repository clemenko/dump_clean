#My back-of-the-napkin thoughts:

##Objective:

##Scripting to anonymize data collected by customers so that the data can be provided to Docker.

##Required outcomes:

- Original data must not be changed.  We make a copy and modify that.
- All changes are logged
- Sane replacement so that obfuscated IP addresses, hostnames, etc can be logically followed in the logs
